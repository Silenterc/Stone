Welcome to Stone. A card game loosely inspired by Hearthstone.

Each Player has 30 health by default. Once he loses all of his health, the game is over and he has lost.

Each Player has a deck of cards. Each deck has by default 15 cards. The cards are by default the same for both Players, but the decks are shuffled randomly.

Each card has damage, health and a type.
Types of cards:
	1, Basic Card - Does not have any special attribute. 

	2, Taunt Card - Has highest priority. That means that if there is a Taunt on the enemy Player's board,
			you have to attack him first. You may attack any Taunt, if there are multiple on the board.

	3, Battlecry Card - Does a special action when played(= you play it from your hand to the board).
	   There are 5 battlecry effects: 1. Draw x cards 
				   	  2. Deal x damage to the enemy board
				    	  3. Deal x damage to everybody(= your hero, your board(except the casting Card), enemy hero, enemy board)
				    	  4. Add x health to your board 
				    	  5. Add x health to your hero


Each Player has a hand. The hand can hold up to 5 cards by default. Every round a player can play one Card on the board.

The board can hold up to 5 cards by default. The board has two sides for the two players.
Cards can attack and be attacked while they are on the board. They can also attack the enemy Player.
